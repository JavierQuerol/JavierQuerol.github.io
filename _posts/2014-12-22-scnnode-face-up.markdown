I've been working on a project where I need to roll a couple of dices, once they are stopped I have to present the score and make some animations. It seems that there are no built in solution to do that, so I made my own. Here it goes a preview:

In fact, I made a [Pod](https://github.com/JavierQuerol/JAQDiceView) available for everyone where you can check the results.
